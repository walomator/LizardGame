Obviously the animation is just a start.

But here's some critiques.

There needs to be a little more force on the chomp.
It needs to feel stickier.
The animation gives the slime a look of too much determination.
It needs to be like a like a mindless opening and closing.

I'd like to also go with a darker palette, more colors on the palette, and better shading.
Here's a good color scheme to start with:

# LizardGame

LizardGame (working title) is an upcoming metroidvania 2D adventure game. Set in a world with only endless cave systems, mysteries lie in every nook and cranny.

Made in the Godot Engine, version 2.1.3, this project is currently in VERY early development. It has already been open sourced under the GPLv3. It is a little early to contribute, but a system to help recommend and implement features in planned.


## Development

Week of 3 September 2017

Rewrote physics
Made enemies killable


Current status: Pre-Alpha, active development

Story:          none - yet
Gameplay:       only barebones framework
Level design:   No work has even been started
Assets:         Good beginnings

The game needs inspiration implemented as code. When it has more substance, it will be easier for outsiders to contribute.

Currently, the two listed authors are heading the game's development. Open sourced early, this project is yet still too young to catch most people's interests, but if it catches yours, reader, star our project and check back in the months to come!


## Design philosophy

The game is made as a labor of love. Code should be open sourced to share with others innovation and inspiration, and to assure a community isn't artificially limited from improving on the original creator's works.

Art assets, so closely tied to the game's code, have also been made free to remix and reuse, to create a completely open source project anyone can feel welcome to contribute to.

Right now, the original developers are exploring what can be done with grass roots game development, and our analysis so far is, it's pretty challenging.
Let us work on making a great GAME experience, not just a great open source proof of concept. Work is being done to open up development to a larger audience, but forgive us if we aren't as coordinated right now.


## Getting the Game Running

The game has been run by opening the source file with the Godot Engine's editor on version 2.1.3. Compilation to a platform has not been attempted, but it is relatively easy to run. Simply search for this game from the editor and play the project.

Glitches, at this stage, are bound to appear. Report them if you have trouble, but it is probably not a compilation problem.


## Contributing

Accepting a pull request from someone randomly is possible, but not expected right now.

Later there will be clear instructions to submitting pull requests.
The first step was to open source, but some more content is needed to give this game direction.


## About the (Upcoming) Wiki

Our wiki page does not exist, but when it does (and it will), it will hopefully be a helpful guide primarily aimed at contributors, coders or otherwise.

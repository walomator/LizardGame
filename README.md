# LizardGame

LizardGame (working title) is an upcoming metroidvania 2D adventure game. Set in a world with only endless cave tunnels, mysteries lie in every nook and cranny.
Made in the Godot Engine, version 2, this project is currently in VERY early development. It has already been open sourced under the GPLv3. It is a little early to contribute, but a system to help recommend and implement features in planned.


## Getting Started

The game has been tested by opening the source with the Godot editor. Compilation has not been attempted, but it is relatively easy to run. Simply search for this game in the Godot editor and play the project.
There are glitches on both Windows and Linux, mainly having to do with the project being so new that the problem hasn't been ironed out.

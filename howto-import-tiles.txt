This is not an exhaustive explanation.

You can make tilemaps in Tiled (though they don't work with any physics yet).

You can import .tmx into Godot as .scn with the Tiled Map Importer addon.
  The addon should be installed automatically because it is captured by git.
  
  If it is not working, you can find Godot addons in the AssetLib tab.
  Scene menu -> Project Settings -> Plugins -> set to Active

In the World.tscn, instance the tilemap, now saved as a scene, as a child scene.

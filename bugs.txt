67 If both directions are held down, the first direction gets priority.
This causes problems when a direction button is released.

20 Jumping upward has no speed limit (though that may not be necessary)

35 Logical error in calculating distance moved since last frame (I think).

47 Possible: may introduce problems running up slopes at the wrong speed.

If character presses on a collision object from the right, he will keep
sprinting even when a movement key is not pressed.
